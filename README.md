# Data_Science_Final_Project

**Data set used in the project:**

1. regression - Home Depot Product Search Relevance
This data set contains several products and real customer search terms from Home Depot's website. In this Assignment, we need to predict a relevance score for the provided combinations of search terms and products (first, character level, and then word/character-combination level). To create the ground truth labels, Home Depot has crowdsourced the search/product pairs to multiple human raters.

2. Classification - PAMAP2
The PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset contains data of 24 different physical activities (such as walking, cycling, playing soccer, etc.), performed by some subjects wearing 3 inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor. The dataset can be used for activity recognition and intensity estimation while developing and applying algorithms of data processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification
