    "First, let's determine the amount of employees with children and the amount of those without:$$ 500 \\times 0.6 = 300 $$$$ 500 - 300 = 200 $$From the calculations follows that there are 300 employees with children and 200 without. Next, we have to caculate the probability that exactly 3 of the 4 randomly chosen have children (note that when one person is chosen, the amount of unchosen people lessens by 1 and the group from which the person was chosen lessens by 1 too):$$ \\frac{300}{500} \\times \\frac{299}{499} \\times \\frac{298}{498} \\times \\frac{200}{497} = 0.08657 $$\n",
    "What remains is multiplying this answer by 4, due to there being 4 possible combinations whether the employee who has no children is chosen first, second, third or forth. Each of these possibilities has the same probability of occuring, hence we do the following:$$ 0.08657 \\times 4 = 0.34628 $$\n",
